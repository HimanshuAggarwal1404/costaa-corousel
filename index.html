            <h2>Adarsh Bharadwaj</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="desc">Adarsh Bharadwaj is always found sleeping during the day, and daydreaming during the night.In his free time he fantasizes about impromptu trips, specially to Delhi. It wasn’t too late that he was found cold-mailing GB Road Institutions for "research" and possible PS-2 opportunities. Speaking of emails, his makeup requests are quite often reciprocated with NC threats (p.s. It’s not a threat anymore). To call attention to his perverse inclinations, Adarsh’s motive while choosing his major (pharmacy) and his PORs (Meera Mess tech lead) was quite clear, picking up chics, and yet he failed miserably One such example is him simping over a senior for an entire semester (by the way his best friend ends up proposing to her). The weird part is, this wasn’t even the first time he was forced into submission by his best friend.  This was enough of a backstory to throw him into the loop of intoxication. The hindrance being his monthly allowance, Adarsh takes a proactive stance on cheap thrills, subsequently earning the title of “Thandai advocate”. In all fairness, Adarsh is one of the most approachable and heartfelt e-bois on campus so feel free to reach out to him for any help or guidance, cause he really needs some. P.s. pharma juniors, help him graduate, or else he’s gonna be here for a long, long time. Presenting the coord of DVM, Adarsh Bharadwaj.
